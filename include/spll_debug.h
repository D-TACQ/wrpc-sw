spll_debug.h - debugging/diagnostic interface

The so-called debug inteface is a large, interrupt-driven FIFO which passes
various realtime parameters (e.g. error value, tags, DAC drive) to an external
application where they are further analyzed. It's very useful for optimizing PI coefficients
and/or lock thresholds.

The data is organized as a stream of samples, where each sample can store a number of parameters.
For example, a stream samples with Y and ERR parameters can be used to evaluate the impact of
integral/proportional gains on the response of the system.

value: value of the parameter.
what: type of the parameter and its' source. For example, 
	- DBG_ERR | DBG_HELPER means that (value) contains the phase error of the helper PLL.
	- DBG_EVENT indicates an asynchronous event. (value) must contain the event type (DBG_EVT_xxx)

last: when non-zero, indicates the last parameter in a sample.
