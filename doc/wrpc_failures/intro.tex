\section{Introduction}

This document provides information about the diagnostics of the White Rabbit
PTP Core (WRPC) - an HDL module present in every White Rabbit node. It is a
complementary documentation to the official \emph{White Rabbit PTP Core User's
Manual} published with every stable release. Please refer to this user manual
for the information about the WRPC, its interfaces and building instructions for
the official reference designs.\\

White Rabbit PTP Core starting from \emph{v4.0} provides diagnostic mechanisms
in the form of SNMP objects and optional Syslog messages (depending on the build
time LM32 software configuration). The implementation of an SNMP agent in the
WRPC is very basic comparing to the diagnostics offered by the White Rabbit
Switch. Since we are very constraint on the code size running inside the WR PTP
Core, almost all of the logic to detect and report errors has to be implemented
on the SNMP Manager's side.\\

This document has many internal hyperlinks that associate SNMP objects with
related problems description and the other way round. These links can be easily
used when reading the document on a computer.
