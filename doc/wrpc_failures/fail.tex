This section tries to identify all the possible ways the White Rabbit PTP Core can
fail. The structure of each error description is the following:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0pt]
	\item [] \underline{Severity}: describes how critical is the fault. Currently
		we distinguish two severity levels:
		\begin{packed_items}
			\item WARNING - means that despite the fault the synchronization
				functionality was not affected so the WRPC behaves correctly in the WR
				network.
			\item ERROR - means that the fault is critical and most probably WRPC
        misbehaves.
		\end{packed_items}
	\item [] \underline{Mode}: for timing failures, it describes which modes are
		affected. Possible values are:
		\begin{packed_items}
      \item \emph{Slave} - the WR Node (WR PTP Core) synchronizes to another WR
        device.
			\item \emph{Grand Master} - the WR Node (WR PTP Core) is at the top of the
				synchronization hierarchy. It is synchronized to an external clock (e.g.
				GPS, Cesium) and provides timing to other WR/PTP devices.
			\item \emph{Master} - the WR Node (WR PTP Core) at the top of the
				synchronization hierarchy. It provides timing to other WR/PTP devices
				but runs from a local oscillator (not synchronized to an external
				clock).
			\item \emph{all} - any WR PTP Core can be affected regardless the timing
				mode.
		\end{packed_items}

	\item [] \underline{Description}: What the problem is about, how important it
		is and what are the effects if it occurs.
	\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: Which SNMP objects should be monitored to
		detect the failure. These are objects from the \texttt{WR-WRPC-MIB}.
	\item [] \underline{Error/Warning condition}: condition that should be checked
		at the SNMP manager's side to detect given problem. Often you will see there
    conditions like:\\
    \texttt{[value] != [value]\_prev} or\\
    \texttt{[value] - [value]\_prev > [threshold]}\\
    where \text{[value]} and \text{[value]\_prev} are the current and previous
    iteration readouts of an SNMP object. This way we check if the value of the
    object has changed from the previous readout or if it has changed by more
    than a safe threshold.
  \item [] \underline{Action}: list of actions that should be performed in case
    of an error/warning. Regardless of the detailed actions described for each
    of the errors below, there are some common remarks that apply to all
    situations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If a procedure given for a specific SNMP object does not solve the
      problem, please contact WR experts to perform a more in-depth analysis of
      the network. For this, you should provide a complete dump of the WRPC
      status generated in the first step of each procedure.
    \item The first action in most of the procedures, called \emph{Dump state}
      requires simply calling a tool provided by WR developers that reads all
      the detailed information from the node and writes it to a single file
      that can be later analyzed by the experts.
    \item If a problem solving procedure requires restarting or replacing a WR
      Node working in the \emph{Grand Master} mode, please make sure that after
      the repair, all other WR devices in the network are synchronized and do
      not report any problems.
    \item If a procedure requires replacing WR Node with a new unit, the
      broken one should be handled to WR experts or the hardware manufacturer to
      investigate the problem.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Timing error}
\label{sec:timing_fail}
As a timing error we define the WR PTP Core not being able to synchronize its
local time to the WR Master (if WRPC runs in the slave mode), or not being able
to provide correct WR time to the rest of the WR network (if WRPC runs in the
master mode). This section contains the list of faults leading to a timing error.

\subsubsection{\bf WR PTP Core operates in a wrong timing mode}
    \label{fail:timing:ppsi_wrong_mode}
    \begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
        If the WRPC operates in a wrong timing mode (i.e. due to the
        configuration error) it will be unable to provide a user application
        with the correct WR time. For example, if the WRPC is supposed to
        operate as Slave but is misconfigured to a Free-running Master mode, its
        time would be different from other WR devices in the network, despite no
        other errors being reported.\\
        To be able to detect this problem, SNMP manager has to be fed with the
        desired timing mode for the each monitored WR node.

        \texttt{wrpcPtpMode != <desired mode>}}
      \item [] \underline{Action}:
        \begin{pck_proc}
        \item Modify the configuration of the WR PTP Core. Please check the
          \emph{White Rabbit PTP Core User's Manual} for instructions how to
          modify the init script to set the timing mode.

\subsubsection{\bf PTP/PPSi went out of \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE}}
		\label{fail:timing:ppsi_track_phase}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Slave}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the \emph{PTP/PPSi} WR servo goes out of the \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE}
				state, this means something bad has happened and the node lost
        synchronization to its Master.

      \item [] \underline{Action}:
        \begin{pck_proc}
        \item Check if the WR Master - timing source, was not restarted. If it
          was, Slave leaving \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE} state is a normal behavior
          and it should automatically re-synchronize.
        \item Dump state
        \item Check the status of the WR Master - timing source. In case it has
          reported some problems, please follow the diagnostics document for the
          WR Switch.
        \item If the switch did not report any problems, restart the WR Node.
        \item If the problem persists replace the WR Node hardware with a new
          unit.
        \item If the problem persists, please notify WR experts.
        \end{pck_proc}

\subsubsection{\bf Offset jump not compensated by Slave}
		\label{fail:timing:offset_jump}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Slave}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				This may happen if the Master resets its WR time counters (e.g. because
				it lost the link to its Master higher in the hierarchy or to external
				clock), but the WR Slave does not follow the jump.
				\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}:\\

      \item [] \underline{Action}:
        \begin{pck_proc}
        \item Dump state
        \item Check the status of the WR Master - timing source. Normally, time
          jumps should not happen and if they do, the problem should be
          investigated on the WR Master side (e.g. \emph{Grand Master} unlocked
          from the external reference).
        \item Restart the WR Node and let it synchronize again.
        \end{pck_proc}

\subsubsection{\bf Detected jump in the RTT value calculated by \emph{PTP/PPSi}}
		\label{fail:timing:rtt_jump}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Slave}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				Once a WR link is established the round-trip delay (RTT) can change
				smoothly due to the temperature variations. However, if a sudden jump is
				detected, that means that an erroneous timestamp was generated either on
				the Master or the Slave side.
				One cause of that could be the wrong value of the t24p transition point.

      \item [] \underline{Action}:
        \begin{pck_proc}
        \item Dump state.
        \item Check the status status of the WR Master - timing source.
          Eventually proceed to investigate the problem on the WR Master side.
        \item Restart the Node.
        \item If the problem persists, replace the WR Node with a new unit.
        \end{pck_proc}

\subsubsection{\bf Wrong $\Delta_{TXM}$, $\Delta_{RXM}$, $\Delta_{TXS}$,
		$\Delta_{RXS}$, $\alpha$ values are reported to the \emph{PTP/PPSi} daemon}
		\label{fail:timing:deltas_report}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Slave}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If \emph{PTP/PPSi} doesn't get the correct values of fixed hardware delays,
				it won't be able to calculate a proper Master-to-Slave delay. Although
				the estimated offset in \emph{PTP/PPSi} is close to 0, the WRPC won't be

\subsubsection{\bf PTP servo is not updating}
		\label{fail:timing:servo_not_updating}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Slave}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If PTP servo is not updating, we still increment the internal timing

          \emph{link down} errors for the WR Node or the WR Master Switch. In
          that case, the SFP optical transceivers should be changed or the fiber
          link should be investigated.

			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the temperature raises too high we might break our electronics. It
				also means that most probably something is wrong with the node cooling.
