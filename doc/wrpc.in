@node Hardware needed
@section Hardware needed

The absolutely minimum hardware you need to build and run the White
Rabbit PTP Core is a PC computer with Linux and one Simple PCIe FMC Carrier
(SPEC) - @uref{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/spec}. However, it is recommended to
use also the DIO FMC card (@uref{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-dio-5chttla})
for storing calibration values and configuration in EEPROM(described later).
To test the White Rabbit synchronization, you will also need:
@itemize
@item second SPEC board with DIO FMC or White Rabbit Switch;
@item pair of SFP transceivers (AXCEN AXGE-1254-0531 and AXCEN AXGE-3454-0531
are recommended);
@item a roll of G652, single mode fiber to connect your SPECs or SPEC with WR
Switch.
@end itemize

@c ##########################################################################
@node Building the Core
@chapter Building the Core

Building the White Rabbit PTP Core is a two step process. First you have to
synthesize the FPGA firmware (gateware). This describes the hardware inside
FPGA that is later used by LM32 software to perform WR synchronization.

To perform the steps below you will need a computer running Linux.

@c ==========================================================================
@node HDL synthesis
@section HDL synthesis

Before running the synthesis process you have to make sure that your
environment is set correctly. You need the Xilinx ISE Software with free
WebPack license installed on a PC. It contains the script @i{settings32.sh}
and @i{settings32.csh} (depending on the shell you use) that sets up all the
system variables required by Xilinx software. For default installation path the
script is located in:

@example
  /opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS/settings32.sh
@end example

and has to be executed before other tools are used. The easiest way to ensure
that @i{ISE}-related variables are set in the shell is to check if @i{$XILINX}
variable contains the path to your @i{ISE} installation directory.

@b{Note:} current version of @i{hdlmake} tool developed at CERN requires
modification of @i{$XILINX} variable after @i{settings32} script execution.
This (provided that the installation path for @i{ISE} is /opt/Xilinx/<version>)
should look like this:

@example
  $ export XILINX=/opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS
@end example

@b{Note:} the Xilinx project file included in the WRPC sources was created with
Xilinx ISE 14.1. It is recommended to use the newest available version of ISE
software.

@sp 1
HDL sources for WR PTP Core can be synthesized with nothing more but Xilinx
ISE software, but using @i{hdlmake} tool developed at CERN is much more
convenient. It creates a synthesis Makefile and ISE project file based on the
set of Manifest.py files deployed among directories inside @i{wr-cores}
repository.

First, please clone the @i{hdlmake} repository from its location given in
@ref{Repositories and Releases}:

@example
  $ git clone git://ohwr.org/misc/hdl-make.git <your_hdlmake_location>
@end example

and add the @i{hdlmake} binary location to your @i{$PATH} to be able to call
it from any directory:

@example
  $ export PATH=<your_hdlmake_location>:$PATH
@end example

@b{Note:} the @i{hdlmake} usage instructions here are based on version 493ce82.
When there will be newer commits, they can be used but please be aware that its
execution parameters may change. In that case please refer to @i{hdlmake}
documentation.

@sp 1
Having Xilinx ISE software and @i{hdlmake} you can clone the main WR PTP Core
git repository and start building the FPGA bitstream. First, please create a
local copy of the @i{wr-cores} in the preferred location on your system. This
release is marked with @value{tagname} tag.

@example
  $ git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores.git <your_wrpc_location>
  $ cd <your_wrpc_location>
  $ git checkout wrpc-v2.0
@end example

If you are using @i{wr-cores} within another project (like @i{wr-nic}),
you may need to check out a different tag instead. Refer to the
documetation if your other project to find which version of this
package you need to exactly rebuild the released binaries.

@b{Note:} alternatively, for the specific v2.0 release, you can get
the release sources from the tarball available in the @i{files} tab of
@code{wr-cores}:

@example
 http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-cores/files
@end example

@sp 1
The subdirectory which contains the main synthesis Manifest.py for SPEC board
and in which you should perform the whole process is:

@example
  $ cd <your_wrpc_location>/syn/spec_1_1/wr_core_demo/
@end example

Executing @i{hdlmake} without any parameters will fetch other git repositories
containing submodules essential for WRPC, and store their local copies to:

@example
  <your_wrpc_location>/ip_cores
@end example

After that, the actual synthesis is just the matter of executing the command:

@example
  $ make
@end example

just as in a regular software compilation process. This takes (depending on
your computer speed) about 15 minutes and if you are lucky (i.e. there were no
errors) it should create FPGA firmware in two files: @i{spec_top.bit} and
@i{spec_top.bin}. The former can be downloaded to FPGA using Xilinx software
(@i{Impact} or @i{Chipscope Pro}) and Xilinx Platform Cable. The latter can be
used to program the Spartan 6 chip on SPEC using the kernel driver from
@i{spec-sw} repository (usage example in @ref{Running and Configuring}).

@sp 1
If, on the other hand, you would like to clean-up the repository and rebuild
everything from scratch you can use the following commands:
@itemize
@item @i{$ make clean} - removes all synthesis reports and log files;
@item @i{$ make mrproper} - removes spec_top.bin and spec_top.bit files;
@item @i{$ hdlmake clean} - removes all fetched repositories (modules) from
                            @i{ip_cores} subdirectory.
@end itemize

@c ==========================================================================
@node LM32 software compilation
@section LM32 software compilation

To compile the LM32 software for White Rabbit PTP Core you will need to
download and unpack the LM32 toolchain from the location mentioned already in
@ref{Repositories and Releases}:

@example
  $ wget http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/1133/lm32.tar.xz
  $ tar xJf lm32.tar.xz -C <your_lm32_location>
@end example

Then you need to setup the @t{CROSS_COMPILE} variable in order
to compile the software for a LM32 processor:

@example
  $ export CROSS_COMPILE="<your_lm32_location>/lm32/bin/lm32-elf-"
@end example

To get the release sources of WRPC software please clone the @i{wrpc-sw} git
repository tagged with @value{tagname} tag. Otherwise, you can use the current master
branch, with the latest improvements and fixes. Finally, if you are using
@i{wrpc-sw} within another project, you may need to checkout a
different tag or specific commit; if this applies,
lease refer to the documentation of the other package to find the exact
version you need to reproduce the released binaries before you make
your changes.

@smallexample
  $ git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores/wrpc-sw.git <your_wrpcsw_location>
  $ cd <your_wrpcsw_location>
  $ git checkout wrpc-v2.0   # or "git checkout master"
@end smallexample

@b{Note:} alternatively you can get the release sources from the tarball
available in the @i{files} tab of the @code{wr-cores} OHWR project.

Before you can compile @i{wrpc-sw}
you need to make a few configuration choices. The package is using
@i{Kconfig} as a configuration engine, so you may run one of the
following commnads (the first is text-mode, the second uses a KDE GUI
and the third uses a Gnome GUI):

@example
   $ make menuconfig
   $ make xconfig
   $ make gconfig
@end example

Other @i{Kconfig} target applies, like @code{config}, @code{oldconfig}
and so on.  A few default known-good configurations are found in
@file{./configs} and you choose them by @i{make}ing them by name
like this:

@example
  $ make spec_defconfig
@end example

The most important configuration choice at this point in time is
whether to enable Etherbone or not. It is disabled by default in
@code{spec_defconfig} and enabled by default in
@code{etherbone_defconfig}.

After the package is configured, just run @code{make} without
parameters to build your binary file:

@example
  $ make
@end example

The first time you build, the @i{Makefile} automatically downloads
the @i{git submodules} of this package, unless you already did that
by hand. The second and later build won't download anything
from the network.

The resulting binary @i{wrc.bin} can be then used with the loader from
@i{spec-sw} software package to program the LM32 inside the White Rabbit PTP
Core (@ref{Running and Configuring}).

@node Downloading firmware to SPEC
@section Downloading firmware to SPEC

There is a Software support for the SPEC board project in @i{ohwr.org}. It
contains a set of Linux kernel drivers and user space tools written by
Alessandro Rubini and Tomasz Wlostowski that are used to communicate with the
SPEC board plugged into the PCI-Express port of the PC.

The instructions in this section are based on commit 27b4ad9 of @i{spec-sw}
repository and are limited to absolutely minimum required to load WRPC FPGA
and LM32 firmware. The full manual for @i{spec-sw} can be found at:

@example
 http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/1506/spec-sw-2012-08-08.pdf
@end example

If there is a newer version of SPEC software support you would like to
use, the up-to-date documentation can always be found in @i{doc/} subdirectory
of @i{spec-sw} git repository.

@sp 1
First, please clone the git repository of SPEC software support package and
build the kernel driver and user space tools:

@smallexample
  $ git clone git://ohwr.org/fmc-projects/spec/spec-sw.git <your_specsw_location>
  $ cd <your_specsw_location>
  $ git checkout 27b4ad9
  $ make
@end smallexample

Then you have to copy the @i{spec_top.bin} to /lib/firmware/fmc/. changing its
name:

@b{Note:} the commands below have to be executed with superuser rights

@example
  $ sudo cp <your_wrpc_location>/syn/spec_1_1/wr_core_demo/spec_top.bin \
        /lib/firmware/fmc/spec-demo.bin
@end example

and after that you are ready to load the @i{spec.ko} driver that configures the
Spartan 6 FPGA on SPEC with a given bitstream (make sure you are in
<your_specsw_location>:

@example
  $ sudo insmod kernel/spec.ko name=demo
@end example

To check if the FPGA firmware file was found by the driver and correctly loaded
to FPGA the @i{dmesg} Linux command can be called. Among plenty of messages
you should be able to find something very similar to:

@smallexample
@noindent
  [99883.768214] spec_probe (device 0003:0000)
  [99883.768220] spec_probe: current 8639 (insmod)
  [99883.768248] spec 0000:03:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
  [99883.768302] spec 0000:03:00.0: irq 49 for MSI/MSI-X
  [99883.768971] spec_load_files
  [99883.774842] spec_load_fpga: got binary file "fmc/spec-demo.bin",
1485512 (0x16aac8) bytes
  [99883.966491] spec_load_submodule: load "fmc/spec-demo": 256
@end smallexample

If everything went right up to this moment you can write the LM32 binary
(@i{wrc.bin}) to the SPEC board. For this purpose, there is a @i{spec-cl} tool
in the @i{spec-sw} repository. Programming is done with the simple command
below:

@example
  $ sudo tools/spec-cl <your_wrpcsw_location>/wrc.bin
@end example

@sp 1
Now you should be able to start the Virtual-UART software (also a part of
@i{spec-sw} package) that will be used to interact with the White Rabbit PTP
Core Shell:

@example
  $ sudo tools/spec-vuart
@end example

If you are able to see the WRPC Shell prompt @i{wrc#} that means the Core is up
and running on your SPEC. Congratulations !


@c ==========================================================================
@node Writing EEPROM and calibration
@section Writing EEPROM and calibration

By default WRPC starts in WR Slave mode, uses the calibration values for
Axcen AXGE-3454-0531 SFP and for release FPGA bitstream available in
@i{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-cores/files}. This might be fine for running
White Rabbit PTP Core for the first time and synchronizing it to WR Switch.
There are however, two mechanisms that are useful when playing more with WRPC
shell and different settings.

@b{Note:} the examples below describe only a subset of WRPC Shell commands
required to make a basic configuration and calibration. A full description of
all supported commands can be found in @ref{WRPC Shell commands}.

@sp 1
First, before making the configuration changes, it is recommended (but not
obligatory) to stop the PTP daemon. Then, the debug messages from daemon would
not show up to the console while you will interact with the shell.

@example
  wrc# ptp stop
@end example

If your SPEC has any Mezzanine board plugged into the FMC connector (e.g. DIO,
Fine Delay, TDC...) then you can create a calibration database inside the FMC
EEPROM. The example below presents the WRPC Shell commands which create an
empty SFP database and add two Axcen transceivers with deltaTx, deltaRx and
alpha parameters associated with them. Those SFPs are most widely used in WR
development and demonstrations:

@example
  wrc# sfp erase
  wrc# sfp add AXGE-1254-0531 46407 183843 73622176
  wrc# sfp add AXGE-3454-0531 46407 183843 -73622176
@end example

To check the content of the SFP database you can execute the @i{sfp show} shell
command.

The calibration procedure of WRPC is limited to absolutely minimum and is fully
automatic. It measures the t2/t4 phase transition point and stores the value
into the FMC EEPROM so that the calibration would not have to be repeated every
time the Core starts. However, it is @b{*important*} to remember that this
calibration function should be executed only once but for @b{*every*} new FPGA
firmware synthesized form @i{wr-cores} repository:

@example
  wrc# ptp stop
  wrc# sfp detect
  wrc# sfp match
  wrc# calibration force
@end example

The example above detects the SFP transceiver plugged into the SPEC board, tries
to read its parameters from our newly created SFP database and forces the
calibration to be executed. The @i{force} argument is required since
@i{calibration} without any arguments tries first to read the t2/t4 phase
transition stored in EEPROM, and does not run the procedure if the value was
previously stored there. That is used to get the measured value and pass it to
PTP daemon before it starts (see init script examples).

@sp 1
The WR PTP Core's mode of operation (WR Master/WR Slave) can be set using the
@i{mode} shell command in one of the following two ways:

@example
  wrc# mode slave
  wrc# mode master
@end example

This stops the PTP daemon, changes the mode of operation, but does not start it
back automatically. Therefore after changing it you need to start the daemon
manually:

@example
  wrc# ptp start
@end example

@sp 2
One option is to type all those commands to initialize the WRPC software to the
required state every time the Core starts. However, you can also write your own
init script to FMC EEPROM and WRPC software will execute it each time it comes
back from the reset state (this also includes coming back from reset after
programming the FPGA and LM32). Building the simple script that reads the
detected SFP parameters and t2/t4 phase transition value from EEPROM, configures
the mode of operation to WR Slave and starts the PTP daemon is presented here:

@example
  wrc# init erase
  wrc# init add ptp stop
  wrc# init add sfp detect
  wrc# init add sfp match
  wrc# init add calibration
  wrc# init add mode slave
  wrc# init add ptp start
@end example

Almost exactly the same one can be used for running SPEC in WR Master mode. The
only difference would be of course @i{init add mode slave} vs. @i{init add mode
master}.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Running the Core
@section Running the Core

Having the SFP database, t2/t4 phase transition point and the init script
created in @ref{Writing EEPROM and calibration} you can restart the WR PTP Core
by reprogramming the LM32 software (with @i{spec-cl} tool) or by typing the
shell command:

@example
  wrc# init boot
@end example

After that you should see the log messages that confirm the init script
execution:

@example
(...)
executing: ptp stop
executing: sfp detect
AXGE-3454-0531
executing: sfp match
SFP matched, dTx=46407, dRx=167843, alpha=-73622176
executing: calibration
Found phase transition in EEPROM: 2384ps
executing: mode slave
SPLL_Init: running as Slave, 1 ref channels, 2 out channels
Locking PLL
executing: ptp start
wrc# SPLL_Init: running as Slave, 1 ref channels, 2 out channels
Enabling ptracker channel: 0
(...)
@end example

Now you should have the White Rabbit PTP Core running in WR Slave mode. The
Shell also contains the monitoring function which you can use to check the WR
synchronization status:

@example
  wrc# gui
@end example

The information is presented in a clear, auto-refreshing screen (full
description about information reported by gui is provided in @ref{WRPC GUI 
elements}):

@sp 1
@center @image{wrpc_mon, 12cm,,wrpc sync monitor}
@sp 1

@b{Note:} the @i{Synchronization status} and @i{Timing parameters} in @i{gui}
are available only in WR Slave mode. When running as WR Master, you would be
able to see only the current date and time, link status, Tx and Rx packet
counters, lock and calibration status.

@sp 1
If you have a DIO Mezzanine board placed on your SPEC, you can check the
synchronization quality by observing the difference between 1-PPS signals from
the WR Master and WR Slave. White Rabbit PTP Core generates 1-PPS signal to the
LEMO connector No. 1 on DIO Mezzanine. However, please remember to use
oscilloscope cables having the same length and type (with the same delay), or
take their delay difference into account in your measurements.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Troubleshooting
@chapter Troubleshooting

@b{My computer hangs on loading spec.ko driver.}

This will occur when you try to load the @i{spec.ko} kernel driver while your
@i{spec-vuart} is running and trying to get messages from Virtual-UART's
registers inside WRPC. Please remember to quit @i{spec-vuart} before reloading
the driver.

@sp 1
@b{I want to synthesize WRPC but hdlmake does nothing, just quits without any
message.}

Please check if you have the Xilinx ISE-related system variables set correctly
(@i{settings32.sh} script provided by Xilinx sets them) and make sure you have
overwritten the @i{$XILINX} variable to:

@example
  $ export XILINX=/opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS
@end example

or similar, if your installation folder differs from default.

@sp 1
@b{WR PTP Core seems to work but I observe on my oscilloscope that the offset
between 1-PPS signals from WR Master and WR Slave is more than 1 ns.}

Run the t2/t4 phase transition value measurement procedure from the WRPC Shell:

@example
  wrc# ptp stop
  wrc# calibration force
@end example

and check if the oscilloscope cables you use have the same delays (or take the
delay difference into account in your measurements).

@sp 1
@b{I can see in the WRPC GUI that the servo cannot reach TRACK_PHASE state.}

Please stop the PTP daemon on your SPEC, read your SFP's parameters from SFP
database you have created in EEPROM and run the t2/t4 phase transition value
measurement procedure form WRPC Shell:

@example
  wrc# ptp stop
  wrc# sfp detect
  wrc# sfp match
  wrc# calibration force
@end example
