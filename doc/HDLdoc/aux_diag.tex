\subsubsection{Auxiliary diagnostics interface}
\label{sec:aux_diag}

Auxiliary diagnostics interface can be used if a user would like to benefit from
the WR PTP Core diagnostics capabilities to export some registers from his/her
IP core. The interface consists of two 32-bit \texttt{std\_logic\_vector}
arrays. User-defined registers that are to be read from the WRPC SNMP agent (SNMP
GET requests), should be connected to the \texttt{aux\_diag\_i} vector.
User-defined values that are written from the WRPC SNMP agent (SNMP SET
requests) will be available in the \texttt{aux\_diag\_o} vector.

Two VHDL generics \texttt{g\_diag\_id} and \texttt{g\_diag\_ver} are used to let
the user uniquely identify given application (user-defined set of registers)
to match it with appropriate, custom SNMP MIB file.
