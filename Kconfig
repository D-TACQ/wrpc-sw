	  This allows to run LM32 code that is aware of IP. The feature is
	  needed to run Etherbone in your gateware, because Etherbone
	  is UDP-based and thus the CPU needs to run DHCP.

config CMD_CONFIG

	  This options adds the "config" command to the shell, which

config DEVELOPER

	help
	  The following options are new features under testing, or
	  special customizations not normally useful for people not
	  directly working on this package.  Please don't use unless
	  you are a developer of wrpc-sw.

config HOST_PROCESS

config RAMSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER && EMBEDDED_NODE
	int "Size of the RAM in the FPGA for this program"
	default 90112
	help
	  The usual configuration for wrpc-sw is 0x16000 bytes
	  (i.e. 88kB = 90112 bytes) but if your project has less or
	  more features you may want to adjust the FPGA size and
	  choose your preferred value here.

config STACKSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER && EMBEDDED_NODE
	int "Size of the stack area needed by this program"
	default 2048
	help
	  The linker complains if the code doesn't fit into RAM, but
	  we must also consider the stack, or the program will crash
	  at run time. (However, we have a detector for overflows).

config PRINT_BUFSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER && WR_NODE
	int "Size for the temporary output string of pp_printf"
	default 128
	help
	  This buffer is constant storage (i.e. wasted space), but it
	  also constraints the maximum lenght of text that can be written
	  in a single call to printf.

config TEMP_POLL_INTERVAL

	help
	  This enables low-level commands: "devmem" to read/write memory
	  and "delays" to read/write the constant delays in this device.
	  Please note that the delays have no immediate effect when set
	  on the master, because they are just sent to the slave
	  during the initial handshake

config FLASH_INIT

# CHECK_RESET for switch and node
config CHECK_RESET
	depends on DEVELOPER && !HOST_PROCESS
	bool "Print a stack trace if reset happens"
	help
	  If the CPU is following a NULL pointer, the program will
	  be restarted. If this option is activated, the main function
	  detects that it is re-executed and dumps a stack trace; it
	  then clears the stack (for next time) and restarts again.

config SPLL_FIFO_LOG
	depends on DEVELOPER && !HOST_PROCESS
	bool "Add a circular buffer for spll logging, used by tools/wrpc-dump"
	help
	  This option addrs 256 bytes to the wrpc bynary, to log
	  the DDMTD tags read from the fifos, the interrupts and the
	  related timing.  The information is shown by tools/wrpc-dump
	  if present, no change/rebuild of the tool is needed.

config PRINTF_XINT
	bool "hex-and-int"
	help
	  This selects a printf that can only print decimal and hex
	  numbers, without obeying the format modifiers. %c and %s are
	  supported too, and %p is equivalent to %x.
	  See pp_printf/README for details.

config PRINTF_FULL
	bool "full"
	help
	  This selects an implementation that supports all standard
	  formats with modifiers, like "%08X" and "%.5s". It costs
	  around 2k of compiled code more than XINT.
	  See pp_printf/README for details.

config PRINTF_MINI
	bool "minimal"
	help
	  This selects a printf that prints all integers as hex,
	  without obeying the format modifiers. %c and %s are
	  supported too. See pp_printf/README for details.
	  This is not probably what you want for wrpc-sw.

config PRINTF_NONE
	bool "empty"
	help
	  This selects a printf that prints the format string
	  alone and ignores all further arguments. Minimal size,
	  but not suited for wrpc-sw. See pp_printf/README for details.

	  Select this option for the ppsi engine (now only option)

config DETERMINISTIC_BINARY

	boolean "Build a binary that is the same every time"
	help
	  This option is used to #ifdef __DATE__ and __TIME__ strings
	  out of the compiled WRC binary. If you set it you'll get the
	  same binary bit-by-bit at each rebuild.  I am using this
	  option to hack the build procedure and use a simple "diff"
	  between the old and new output to verify I didn't introduce
	  changes.

	  If in doubt, say No.

config UART
	boolean "Use hardware uart (and/or vuart if available)"
	depends on DEVELOPER && EMBEDDED_NODE
	help
	  This option selects the serial driver, connected to either

	  to how the gateware is built. 

config UART_SW
	depends on DEVELOPER && EMBEDDED_NODE
	default !UART
	boolean "Use software uart"
	help
	  The software uart is made up of two circular buffers. It can
	  be used either as an alternative to the harwdare UART or as
	  an addition. If the option is turned on, ppsi log messages
	  are routed to the software uart. The interactive wrpc shell
	  and diagnostics run on the hardware UART if available.

config NET_VERBOSE
	depends on DEVELOPER && WR_NODE
	boolean "Extra verbose messages for networking"
	help
	  This is mainly a debug tool, to be left off unless you hack
	  in the network subsystem.

config PLL_VERBOSE
	depends on DEVELOPER
	boolean "Verbose messages in softpll"
	help
	  The softpll is usually silent in WR node and verbose in WR
	  switch. You can enable pll messages in WR node for debugging.

	  A debug tool for people changing the packet filter rules

config WRC_VERBOSE

	  This enables some more diagnostic messages. Normally off.

config SNMP_VERBOSE

	help
	  This enables some more diagnostic messages. Normally off.

config FAKE_TEMPERATURES
	depends on DEVELOPER
	boolean "Offer an array of 3 fake temperatures, for testing"
	help
	  The option adds also a "faketemp" command, used to set
	  the fake temperatures: e.g. "faketemp 120 -10 50"
