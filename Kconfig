config ETHERBONE
	boolean "Compile Etherbone support in wrpc-sw"
	help
	  This allows to run LM32 code that is aware of Etherbone.
	  You need to run a gateware file that includes Etherbone support.
	  If in doubt, say No.

config DETERMINISTIC_BINARY
       boolean "Build a binary that is the same every time"
       help
         This option is used to #ifdef __DATE__ and __TIME__ strings
	 out of the compiled WRC binary. If you set it you'll get the
	 same binary bit-by-bit at each rebuild.  I am using this
	 option to hack the build procedure and use a simple "diff"
	 between the old and new output to verify I didn't introduce
	 changes.

	 If in doubt, say No.
